## Code Guide

- Majority of code present in the[ main.dart file.](https://github.com/sum20156/App_Account_Deletion_Request/blob/b4e9d0ba8ce5af2ab7c805291e055504c79cf3a5/lib/main.dart). If you want to change any text you can search for those in this file and replace it.
- [deleteUserData(String userId)](https://github.com/sum20156/App_Account_Deletion_Request/blob/e1c72cdb8652273e3ef75c79223c636a7acaba5e/lib/main.dart#L48) contains logics related to the data deletion, you have to modify the code according to your need. In my case user data is stored in **USERS** collection. Don't worry the syntax is very similar to java/kotlin.
- Replace[ app_icon.png](https://github.com/sum20156/App_Account_Deletion_Request/blob/master/assets/app_icon.png) and [favicon.png](https://github.com/sum20156/App_Account_Deletion_Request/blob/master/web/favicon.png) with your app logo.
